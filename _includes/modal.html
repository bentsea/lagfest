                        <p>Ubergeeks Cosplay - Team UGC began cosplaying in 2013 as a two person team. Founded officially in 2014 as a competition duo, they competed and won their first best in show for Alphonse Elric. Since then, they have added an official third member as a handler and gone on to win numerous consecutive best in show awards in the past 2 years, most recently winning best in show at Wizard World new Orleans 2016. The concept behind Team UGC is simple: teach. Understanding building methods and pushing information out there is the most important goal and entire reason this group was formed. Through their YouTube channel, where the duo streams build advice and how tos on a bevy of topics from building to con education as well as Cayne's monthly articles in Geekdom magazine where she talks all things cosplay, Team UGC has lived up to their goal of being not just teachers but active memeber of the cosplay Community. Pushing cosplay forward while also helping everyone enjoy cosplay is their M.O. Recently, they helped found the NWLA Nerd Herd, which is a non profit that focuses on kids battling cancer and various other serious illnesses.  Though cosplay, the Nerd Herd hopes to reach kids who may feel left behind while also giving the kids a chance to not just have a break,but learn life lessons through workshops and interactive events featuring cosplayers from around their hometown.</p>

                        <p>Tripp the Tech, also known as UberGeek Tripp. One half of the founding member of team UGC,  Tripp specializes in the tech factors of all of the fabrications. His roles includes all of the 3d modeling, pepakura, lighting effects, coding and generally giving the wow factor to everything we do. Want to know how to make something work? Need to understand the technical aspects of creating effects and lighting? Ask Tripp. With over 12 years in the computer/coding industry, he is the go to guy in team UGC for all things technical.</p>

                        <p>Cayne the creator, also known as UberGeek Cayne. As the other half of the founding members, Cayne began 15 years ago sewing. Her role is concept, design and execution of the cosplays. No detail is too small for her nor is anything safe! Cayne like pulling from any and all aspects of cosplay building. Foam, leather, bondo, Sintra and of course fabrics, if it sits still long enough, it will get put in a cosplay. Cosplay on a budget? Need to understand how to modify a pattern using only some duct tape and twine? Ask cayne. </p>

                        <p>Lorax the lifesaver, also known as UberGeek Lorax. Handlers are important!  Lorax joined team UGC in 2014 and since then has been the most important part of our competition cosplay as well as taking over video editing for the YouTube channel. He is mainly responsible for keeping both Tripp and Cayne in line as well as ensuring they do the important things (like reminding them to eat).</p>

                        <p>Eric, or “Cherry” as many of us know him as, has been a major part of the anime community in Central Texas since the beginning of the new millenium. As a stage actor out of high school, he quickly became involved in multiple cosplay performance groups in North Texas, winning multiple events at A­Kon and Animefest in Dallas. This passion for anime and a gregarious personality lead to his meeting with and auditioning at FUNimation Entertainment.</p>

                        <p>In that time, Eric has been in more than 23 series. He can be heard in FUNimations newest series, Assassination Classroom as Takuya Muramatsu ​along with parts in Ben­To and Space Dandy and the international hit series, Attack on Titan. He has also been in many fan favorites such as: Fairy Tail, KenIchi the Mightiest Disciple, Initial D and One Piece to name a few.</p>
